## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training (200 epochs)

```bash
# Local execution
python main.py --epochs 200

# Or via SLURM (GPU cluster)
sbatch run_200epochs.sh
```

### Standalone Scripts

```bash
# Train only
python scripts/train.py --epochs 200 --output-dir ./outputs

# Evaluate OOD (requires trained model)
python scripts/evaluate_ood.py --checkpoint ./outputs/checkpoints/best_model.pth

# Analyze Neural Collapse
python scripts/analyze_nc.py --checkpoint ./outputs/checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

## 📊 Results Summary

### Training Performance
- **Test Accuracy**: 78.65% (CIFAR-100, 100 classes)
- **Best Epoch**: 161 (saved to `best_model.pth`)
- **Training Time**: ~20 minutes on NVIDIA L40S GPU

### OOD Detection (AUROC)

| Method | SVHN | DTD |
|--------|------|-----|
| Energy | **0.876** | 0.784 |
| NECO | 0.840 | **0.813** |
| Max Logit | 0.869 | 0.784 |
| MSP | 0.846 | 0.779 |
| Mahalanobis | 0.688 | 0.781 |
| ViM ⚠️ | 0.225 | 0.451 |

### Neural Collapse Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| NC1 | 1,126,273 | Partial collapse (expected at 78% acc) |
| NC2 (angle) | -0.0101 | ✅ Perfect simplex! |
| NC3 (alignment) | 0.977 | ✅ Strong weight-mean alignment |
| NC4 (agreement) | 100% (train) | ✅ NCC = Softmax |
| NC5 (test) | 96.89% | ✅ Generalizes to test data |

## 🔬 Key Insights

1. **Neural Collapse is real**: Despite only 78% accuracy, NC2-NC5 show strong geometric structure
2. **Simple methods work**: Energy score (0.876 AUROC) outperforms complex ViM
3. **Dataset matters**: NECO excels on textures (DTD), Energy on street numbers (SVHN)
4. **ViM needs debugging**: Poor performance suggests hyperparameter tuning needed

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **ViM performance**: AUROC of 0.225 (needs hyperparameter tuning)
2. **NC1 not collapsed**: Expected at 78% accuracy; would need >95% for full collapse
3. **Large checkpoints**: Intermediate checkpoints excluded from repo (~2.6GB total)
